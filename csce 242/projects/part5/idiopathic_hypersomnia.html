            <h2>Idiopathic Hypersomnia</h2>
            <p>Idiopathic hypersomnia is a condition that is characterized by extreme sleepiness during the day, no matter how much sleep someone gets. People with this condition often have trouble waking up from sleep and do not feel refreshed by naps.</p>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Excessive daytime sleepiness:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia have daytime sleepiness that makes it hard to function, no matter how much sleep they get.</li>
                <li><strong>Long sleep times:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia may sleep for 10 hours or more at night and still feel the need to nap during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe sleep inertia:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia may have extreme difficulty waking up in the morning.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusion upon waking:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia often wake up confused, and move slowly or have trouble with coordination after waking up.</li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty thinking or concentrating:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia may have a hard time thinking or concentrating during the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Long naps:</strong> People with idiopathic hypersomnia often take naps longer than one hour. Naps often do not leave people with idiopathic hypersomnia feeling refreshed.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>A sleep medicine physician can diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia with the help of several diagnostic tools, such as:</p>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Epworth Sleepiness Scale:</strong> A scale that uses short questions to measure your degree of sleepiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep records:</strong> A record your sleep patterns for a week or two.</li>
                <li><strong>Polysomnography:</strong> A polysomnography, or sleep study, is an overnight test performed at a medical facility that meaures brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and leg and eye movements when sleeping.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple sleep latency test:</strong> This test will measure how long it takes for you to fall asleep during the day over the course of five naps, each spaced two hours apart.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>It is estimated that only 0.002 to 0.010 percent of the population suffers from idiopathic hypersomnia. This disorder is more frequently found in women.</p>
