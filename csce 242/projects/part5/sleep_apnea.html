            <h2>Sleep Apnea</h2>
            <p>Sleep apnea is a sleep-wake disorder characterized by pauses in breathing while asleep. These pauses cause people with this condition to briefly wake up, preventing them from getting a restful, healthy sleep. There are three main types of sleep apnea: obstructive sleep apnea, which occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the flow of air into the lungs; central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain does not send proper siganls to the muscles that control breathing; and treatment-emergent central sleep apnea, which happens when someone with obstructive sleep apnea converts to central sleep apnea when receiving therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.</p>

                        <li><strong>Loud snoring: </strong>People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. This symptom has to be reported by another person.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pauses in breathing during sleep: </strong>People with sleep apnea often have episodes in which they stop breathing when asleep. This symptom has to be reported by another person.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gasping for air during sleep: </strong>People with sleep apnea often have moments of gasping for air when asleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dry mouth: </strong>People with sleep apnea often wake up with dry mouth.</li>

                        <li><strong>Insomnia: </strong>People with sleep apnea often experience difficulty staying asleep, also known as insomnia.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execessive daytime sleepiness: </strong>People with sleep apnea often experience daytime sleepiness that makes it hard to function.</li>
                        <li><strong>Issues with concentration and mood: </strong>People with sleep apnea often have irritability and difficulty concentrating during the day.</li>

            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <section class="symptom_col">
                    <p>A sleep medicine physician can diagnose idiopathic hypersomnia with the help of several diagnostic tools, such as:</p>
                    <ul class="symptom_list">
                        <li><strong>Sleep records:</strong> A record your sleep patterns for a week or two.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sleep partner questionnaire:</strong> If applicable, your sleep partner may be given a questionnaire on your sleep habits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Polysomnography:</strong> A polysomnography, or sleep study, is an overnight test performed at a medical facility that meaures brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and leg and eye movements when sleeping.</li>
                        <li><strong>Home sleep tests:</strong> A health care provider may opt to use simplified tests to be used at home to diagnose sleep apnea. These tests measure heart rate, blood oxygen level, airflow, and breathing patterns.</li>

            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>It is estimated that 26 percent of adults between the ages of 30 and 70 have sleep apnea. Older populations and men are generally more likely to have either central or obstructive sleep apnea.</p>

                    <p>Many treatments exist to help people who have sleep apnea, such as:</p>
                    <ul class="symptom_list">
                        <li><strong>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP):</strong> CPAP machines deliver air pressure through a mask while you sleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Other airway pressure devices:</strong> Auto-CPAPs, which automatically adjust the air pressure while you sleep, or bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) machines can help treat sleep apnea.</li>
                        <li><strong>Oral appliances:</strong> You could wear an oral appliance that is designed to keep your throat open while you sleep.</li>
                        <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Many surgical options exist, like tissue removal or shrinkage to clear the airway, jaw repositioning, implants, nerve stimulation, or tracheostomy.</li>
