            <h2>Narcolepsy</h2>
            <p>Narcolepsy is a sleep-wake disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden muscle weakness (cataplexy), sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.
                There are two types of narcolepsy. Type 1 narcolepsy involves cataplexy, while type 2 narcolepsy does not.
            </p>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Excessive daytime sleepiness:</strong> People with narcolepsy have daytime sleepiness that makes it hard to function, no matter how much sleep they get.</li>
                <li><strong>Automatic behaviors:</strong> People with narcolepsy can continue doing an automatic task like writing, typing, or driving when they fall asleep.</li>
                <li><strong>Cataplexy:</strong> Sudden loss of muscle tone, or cataplexy, can occur with people with type 1 narcolepsy during episodes of intense emotions. Episodes of cataplexy can be mild, like a drooping of the eyelids when laughing, or severe, like falling over. Some people only experience episodes of cataplexy once or twice a year, while others might have several episodes a day.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep paralysis:</strong> People with narcolepsy may experience episodes where they cannot move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep-related hallucinations:</strong> Sometimes people with narcolepsy can see or hear things that are not there when falling asleep or waking up. Hypnagogic hallucinations are hallucinations that occur when falling asleep, while hypnopompic hallucinations are hallucinations that occur upon waking.</li>
                <li><strong>Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep:</strong> Typically, people enter REM within 60 to 90 minutes of falling asleep; however, people with narcolepsy tend to enter REM within 15 minutes of falling asleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>A sleep medicine physician can diagnose narcolepsy with the help of several diagnostic tools, such as:</p>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Epworth Sleepiness Scale:</strong> A scale that uses short questions to measure your degree of sleepiness.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep records:</strong> A record your sleep patterns for a week or two.</li>
                <li><strong>Polysomnography:</strong> A polysomnography, or sleep study, is an overnight test performed at a medical facility that meaures brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and leg and eye movements when sleeping.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple sleep latency test:</strong> This test will measure how long it takes for you to fall asleep during the day over the course of five naps, each spaced two hours apart.</li>
                <li><strong>Lumbar puncture:</strong> Type 1 narcolepsy can be tested for using a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, to measure the level of hypocretin in the spinal fluid.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>Narcolepsy affects an estimated 1 in every 2,000 people in the United States. It is estimated that 50% of people with narcolepsy are undiagnosed</p>
