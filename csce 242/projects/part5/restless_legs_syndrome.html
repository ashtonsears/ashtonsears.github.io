            <h2>Restless Legs Syndrome</h2>
            <p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a movement disorder characterized by a strong urge to move the legs when asleep or resting.</p>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Uncomfortable sensations that begin while resting: </strong>People with RLS experience an itching, crawling, creeping, pulling, throbbing, aching, or electric feeling sensation in the legs that begins after lying down or sitting for an extended period of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Relief with movement: </strong>People with RLS are relieved of the uncomforatble sensations in the legs by stetching, jiggling the legs, pacing, or walking.</li>
                <li><strong>Worsening of symptoms in the evening: </strong>People with RLS experience worse symptoms at night.</li>
                <li><strong>Nighttime leg twitching: </strong>People with RLS are at higher risk of another common condition called periodic limb movement of sleep, which causes the legs to twitch and kick during sleep.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>A sleep medicine physician can diagnose RLS with the help of the following criteria established by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group:</p>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>A strong, often irresistible urge to move the legs, often occuring with uncomfortable feelings in the legs.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms that get worse when resting.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms that are partially or temporarily relieved by leg movement.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms that get worse at night.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Symptoms cannot be explained solely by another medical or behavioral condition.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>It is estimated that between 5 and 10 percent of adults and 2 to 4 percent of children have RLS. This disorder affects women more than men.</p>
