                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Getting a diagnosis for a sleep disorder can be a long and frustrating journey.
                        Many individuals with sleep disorders experience an eight to nineteen year gap between onset of symptoms and diagnosis.
                        This is due to a variety of reasons, including lack of knowledge of symptoms, lack of access to a sleep clinician, and lack of primary care provider awareness.
                        Struggling with sleep disorder symptoms like chronic fatigue, insomnia, and breathing issues for a long period of time can severely impact sleep health, which affects overall well-being.
                    </p>
                    <p>At Sleep Symptom Tracker, we recognize the importance of a quick and accurate diagnosis for these disorders, which is why we have created this platform.
                        Sleep Symptom Tracker is a user-friendly tool that allows patients to document their sleep patterns and symptoms all in one place.
                        By equipping patients with detailed insights into their sleep patterns, we aim to make conversations with healthcare providers more productive and efficient.
                        Our platform is designed to help users recognize patterns, track changes over time, and present clear data that can help in the diagnostic process.
