            <h2>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome</h2>
            <p>Delayed sleep phase syndrome is a circadian rhythm disorder that is characterized by a delay of two hours or more from usual sleep patterns. This means that people with this disorder fall asleep later and wake up later than normal. 
                There are two types of delayed sleep phase syndrome: circadian aligned, meaning the onset of melatonin is less than two hours before falling asleep, and circadian misaligned, meaning the onset of melatonin happens more than two hours before falling asleep.</p>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Insomnia: </strong>People with delayed sleep phase syndrome are not able to fall asleep at a typical bedtime.</li>
                <li><strong>Severe sleep inertia:</strong> People with delayed sleep phase syndrome have extreme difficulty waking up according to societal norms.</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive daytime sleepiness:</strong> People with delayed sleep phase syndreom have daytime sleepiness that makes it hard to function, due to following societal norms.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
            <p>A sleep medicine physician can diagnose delayed sleep phase syndrome with the help of several diagnostic tools, such as:</p>
            <ul class="symptom_list">
                <li><strong>Actigraphy: </strong> This test tracks your sleep and wake times over several days with the help of a small device you wear on your wrist.</li>
                <li><strong>Sleep records: </strong>A record your sleep patterns for a week or two.</li>
                <li><strong>Polysomnography: </strong>A polysomnography, or sleep study, is an overnight test performed at a medical facility that meaures brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and leg and eye movements when sleeping.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prevalence</h3>
            <p>An estimated 3.3 to 4.6 percent of adolescents and young adults suffer from delayed sleep phase disorder. The prevalence of this disorder is decreased in adults, with only an estimated 0.2 to 1.7 percent of the adult population having delayed sleep phase syndrome.</p>
