            <h2>Who Needs Sleep?</h2>
            <p>Sleep's biological purpose remains a mystery.
                However, what we do know is that sleep is as essential to life as food and water— it is so important that the average person will spend a third of their life doing it.
                Sleep affects many parts of the body and plays a role in brain function, memory consolidation, heart function, metabolism, immune function, mood, and disease resistance.
                Most adults need around seven to nine hours of sleep every night. 
                Not getting enough sleep every night can increase the risk of problems like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, and obesity.
            </p>
            <p>Sleep disorders are conditions that affect the amount and quality of one's sleep. 
                These disorders can have affects on a person's overall health, safety, and quality of life; however, many people with sleep disorders go undiagnosed. 
                Around 50% of people with narcolepsy and 90% of people with sleep apnea are undiagnosed, and therefore are also untreated.
                There are many barriers to diagnosis, but an important one to acknowledge is that symptoms of sleep disorders often get overlooked by health care providers.
                Sleep Symptom Tracker exists to help people identify and track symptoms of sleep disorders to help with the diagnostic process.
