        <h1>Streaming and Screaming</h1>
        <p>Video streaming allows users to binge TV and movies (mostly) ad-free at a cost lower than traditional cable. 
            It's no wonder why 85% of US households have subscriptions to at least one video streaming service. 
            The global video streaming market was valued at a whopping $60.1 billion in 2021, and this number is expected to grow larger every year until 2030. 
            However, despite its large appeal and popularity, video streaming has become a bloated industry that has become overwhelming for many consumers.</p>
        <p>As of 2024, there were over 200 video streaming services available worldwide. 
            In fact, Americans have an average of four streaming services subscriptions, with 7% of Americans having six or more streaming subscriptions. 
            Many users are frustrated that they have to juggle so many subscriptions to gain access to the shows and movies they want. 
            This frustration has led to many funny social media posts about the large number of streaming services, like the one below that was posted to Tumblr. 
            Hopefully, the industry will recognize this problem and work towards a solution that eases consumer concerns.</p>
