            <h2 class="text">What is this, Candy Crush?</h2>
            <p class="text">Categorizing Cookie Run: Kingdom (CRK) in the same realm as Candy Crush is, frankly, offensive to me as an avid Cookie Run player.
                The two games could not be any more different. 
                First of all, Candy Crush is a simple match-three game where you match candies to clear levels. It's a game so simple, even my mom enjoys it.
                On the other hand, CRK is a strategy game where you build a kingdom, train cookies, and fight against the evil baked goods that threaten the world.
                There are many different modes of gameplay, including PvP, PvE, special boss battle, and guild battles. 
                Plus, the game is constantly updated with new content, so there's no shortage of entertainment.</p>
            <p class="text">At the center of CRK's gameplay is its unqiue cast of characters. 
                There are over 100 different cookies to collect, each with their own unique abilities and powers. 
                At the center of CRK's story are the Ancient Heroes, five special cookies that act as guardians of peace.
                Their power comes from their Soul Jams, which chose each Ancient Cookie based on the purity of their character.
                However, the Soul Jams originally belonged to the Beast Cookies, who were corrupted by their vast power. 
                As a punishment, these Beast Cookies lost their Soul Jams and were locked away by Witches.
                Now, the Beast Cookies are active again, and its up to the Ancient Heroes and their friends to stop them before they take over the world.</p>
